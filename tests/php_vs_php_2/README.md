# PHP vs PHP 2

This is the second trial to make the performance comparision between several PHP codes.

## The tests is performed with containers

Check the folder `docker-receipt` to found the testing code.

## Folder 1_1

This is a folder to keep apart a docker receipt that will have an environment where each container is a different application setup. A plan to put others variants, like as a single container shipping all applications, but it will be in future.

Go to [1_1](docker-receipt/1_1/README.md) to see how to perform the test.
