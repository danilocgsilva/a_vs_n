# Haw php file

Lets print a hello world with zero framework!

Say that you deal is to print something very, very simple, dynamicaly. In such situation, doing so based ona framework may add unecessary overhead, though it is a very unlikely scenario.

Anyway, I think that knowing the most basic php usage and check its overhead is a very important think to make us thing in the importance, viability and even the maturity of current frameworks.

If you want to rise this environmento to test, know that this folder uses Docker to build the resources. Just run `docker-compose up -d --build` and your place are ready to be tested. Check the `docker-compose.yml` port to see where the application will be served.
