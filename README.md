# a_vs_n

Compares performance of different technologies for the same operations and records the results in a structured way. This allows results to be easily consumed, as well make tests reproductions, so others can re-state results, fine-grained tests or address doubts and news circumstances where technologies behaviours may vary.

## File/folders list

* `helpers_projects`: Projects that shoud be used indirectly by tests.
* [`tests`](tests/README.md): The main folder, containing the documentation of results and procedures taken.
