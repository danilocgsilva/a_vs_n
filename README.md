# a_vs_n

Compares performance from different technologies for same operations and registers the results in a structured way. So results can be *consumed* easily, as well make tests reproductions, so others can re-state results, fine grainy tests or leverage doubts and news circunstanves where technologies behaviours may vary.

## File/folders list

* `helpers_projects`: Projects that shoud be used indirectly by tests.
* `tests`: The main folder, containing the documentation of results and procedures taken.
